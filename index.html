    <h2>SO WHY IS THIS NOW POSSIBLE?</h2>
    
    <p>Previously, federal rules regulating the formation of banks were restrictive with significant barrier to entry. These restrictions were lifted in the May 2017 budget when bank related licensing requirements were softened to encourage the banking sector to be modernised.</p>

    <p>Xinja has applied for an approved deposit-taking institution (ADI) licence and on approval plans to launch its first prepaid card late this year before moving into the home loan and deposit account markets in mid-2018. Xinja is a great example of the implementation of disruptive technologies that will revolutionise banking in Australia, similar to digital banks that have launched overseas.</p>

    <p>While this (solely) mobile-app driven business may be a new player in the Aussie banking landscape, similar business models have experienced massive success and huge growth abroad, particularly in the UK.</p>

    <p>The actual investment offering will be available very soon through Equitise and you can register your interest now to make sure you’re invited to participate when the ‘deal room’ is open before the broader public market is invited.</p>

    <p>Register below to ensure you have early access to this truly unique opportunity.</p>
